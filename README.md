# Bookify

Bookify is a fictional website where you can browse and review books. It was originally made for Harvard's CS50 Web Programming course on EDX. It uses the Flask micro-framewok for backend and Bootstrap for the frontend. A local SQLite3 database filled with sample book data is used for development purposes.
